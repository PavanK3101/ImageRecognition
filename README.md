# üì∏ Image Recognition System

A comprehensive web-based Image Recognition System built with Flask, TensorFlow/Keras, and OpenCV. This project provides a robust framework for uploading images, performing real-time object classification using pre-trained or custom models, and visualizing key image features and prediction results.

## ‚ú® Features

* **Web Interface (Flask):** User-friendly front-end for image uploads (via file or URL) and displaying predictions.
* **Deep Learning Model Integration:**
    * Supports popular pre-trained CNN architectures like MobileNetV2, ResNet50, and VGG16 (transfer learning).
    * Includes an option for a custom CNN model built from scratch.
    * Ability to load and save trained models and their metadata.
* [cite_start]**Image Preprocessing:** Automatic resizing, normalization, and format conversion to prepare images for model inference[cite: 226, 227, 228, 229].
* [cite_start]**Image Enhancement:** Utilizes OpenCV to apply real-time image enhancements (noise reduction, histogram equalization, sharpening) for improved quality[cite: 231, 232, 233].
* [cite_start]**Feature Extraction:** Extracts and displays basic image features like dimensions, color properties, brightness, and contrast[cite: 235, 236, 237, 238, 239].
* [cite_start]**Real-time Predictions:** Get instant classification results with confidence scores for uploaded images[cite: 261, 262].
* [cite_start]**Batch Prediction:** Upload multiple images at once for efficient, concurrent processing and results display[cite: 280, 281].
* [cite_start]**Model Management:** Centralized configuration for model paths, image sizes, and training parameters[cite: 223, 224].
* [cite_start]**Interactive UI:** Dynamic updates, loading spinners [cite: 297][cite_start], and progress bars [cite: 294] to enhance user experience.
* [cite_start]**Responsive Design:** Styled with Bootstrap and custom CSS for optimal viewing on various devices[cite: 287, 428].

## üöÄ Getting Started

Follow these instructions to set up and run the Image Recognition System on your local machine.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* `pip` (Python package installer)

### Installation

1.  **Clone the repository:**

    ```bash
    git clone [https://github.com/your-username/image-recognition-system.git](https://github.com/your-username/image-recognition-system.git)
    cd image-recognition-system
    ```

2.  **Create a virtual environment (recommended):**

    ```bash
    python -m venv venv
    # On Windows
    .\venv\Scripts\activate
    # On macOS/Linux
    source venv/bin/activate
    ```

3.  **Install the required dependencies:**

    ```bash
    pip install -r requirements.txt
    ```

    [cite_start]The `requirements.txt` file should contain the following packages and versions[cite: 286]:

    ```
    Flask==2.3.3
    tensorflow==2.13.0
    opencv-python==4.8.0.76
    Pillow==10.0.1
    numpy==1.24.3
    matplotlib==3.7.2
    seaborn==0.12.2
    requests==2.31.0
    Werkzeug==2.3.7
    ```

### Running the Application

1.  [cite_start]**Set up directories:** The `config.py` file includes a `create_directories` method [cite: 224] which will automatically create `static/uploads`, `models`, `static`, and `templates` folders if they don't exist.

2.  **Run the Flask application:**

    ```bash
    python app.py
    ```

    The application will typically run on `http://127.0.0.1:5000/`. Open this URL in your web browser.

## ‚öôÔ∏è Configuration

[cite_start]The `config.py` file manages various settings for the application[cite: 223]:

* [cite_start]**`UPLOAD_FOLDER`**: Directory for storing uploaded images[cite: 223].
* [cite_start]**`MODEL_FOLDER`**: Directory for storing trained models[cite: 223].
* **`SECRET_KEY`**: Essential for Flask session security. **Change this to a strong, random key in a production environment.**
* [cite_start]**`MAX_CONTENT_LENGTH`**: Maximum allowed file size for uploads (default 16MB)[cite: 223].
* [cite_start]**`ALLOWED_EXTENSIONS`**: Permitted image file types[cite: 223].
* [cite_start]**`IMAGE_SIZE`**: Target dimensions for image preprocessing (default 224x224 for most models)[cite: 223].
* [cite_start]**`MODEL_NAME`**: Base name for saved models[cite: 224].
* [cite_start]**`CONFIDENCE_THRESHOLD`**: Minimum confidence score for a prediction to be displayed[cite: 224].
* [cite_start]**`TOP_K_PREDICTIONS`**: Number of top predictions to retrieve[cite: 224].
* [cite_start]**Training Settings:** `BATCH_SIZE`, `EPOCHS`, `LEARNING_RATE`, `VALIDATION_SPLIT`[cite: 224].

## üß† Model Training

The `model_trainer.py` script provides functionalities to create and train deep learning models:

### Creating a Model

You can choose from pre-trained models or a custom CNN:

```python
trainer = ModelTrainer(config)
# For MobileNetV2 (transfer learning)
[cite_start]model = trainer.create_model(num_classes=10, model_type='mobilenet') # [cite: 241, 242, 243]
# For ResNet50
[cite_start]model = trainer.create_model(num_classes=10, model_type='resnet') # [cite: 243, 244]
# For VGG16
[cite_start]model = trainer.create_model(num_classes=10, model_type='vgg') # [cite: 244, 245]
# For a custom CNN model
[cite_start]model = trainer.create_model(num_classes=10, model_type='custom') # [cite: 245, 248]
````

### Training the Model

To train a model, you'll typically use `tf.keras.preprocessing.image.ImageDataGenerator` to create data generators:

```python
# Example: (You'll need to set up your data directories)
# from tensorflow.keras.preprocessing.image import ImageDataGenerator
# train_datagen = ImageDataGenerator(rescale=1./255, validation_split=config.VALIDATION_SPLIT)
# train_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
#     'path/to/train_data',
#     target_size=config.IMAGE_SIZE,
#     batch_size=config.BATCH_SIZE,
#     class_mode='categorical',
#     subset='training'
# )
# validation_generator = train_datagen.flow_from_directory(
#     'path/to/train_data',
#     target_size=config.IMAGE_SIZE,
#     batch_size=config.BATCH_SIZE,
#     class_mode='categorical',
#     subset='validation'
# )

# [cite_start]history = trainer.train_model(train_generator, validation_generator, train_generator.class_names) # [cite: 251, 252, 255]
# [cite_start]trainer.save_model() # [cite: 256, 257]
```
